/**
 * Interface for receiving test execution results as they stream in.
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link RuntimeHook}, ResultListener is purely observational and cannot
 * abort execution. Use this for reporting, telemetry, and external integrations.
 * <p>
 * The scenario is the smallest unit of granularity - step-level events are not
 * streamed as they add overhead without significant reporting value.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * Runner.path("features/")
 *     .resultListener(new HtmlReportListener())
 *     .resultListener(new TelemetryListener())
 *     .parallel(10);
 * </pre>
