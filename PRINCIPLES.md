# Karate v2 Design Principles

Lessons learned from real-world usage since 2017, distilled into the principles guiding this rewrite.

---

## 1. Backwards Compatible

All Karate 1.x features will work and migration will be straightforward.

## 2. Clear Priorities

Most users depend on API Testing, so the first few releases of Karate v2 will focus on this first, enabling users to validate compatibility.

1. API Testing
2. API Mocks
3. API Performance Testing
4. Web Browser Automation

Web browser automation, cross-platform desktop automation and mobile automation will be looked at only after the top priorities are proven stable.

## 3. Fresh Start, Latest Stack

A ground-up rewrite that references 1.x code where useful. No legacy constraints. Make the most of the latest Java syntax and features such as virtual threads.

## 4. Zero-Friction Installation

Non-Java teams will be able to install and use Karate without wrestling with JVM setup. See [Karate CLI](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate-cli).

## 5. Polyglot by Design

First-class interoperability with non-Java code (.NET, Python, Go, Rust). This foundation enables platform-specific automation: desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux) and mobile (iOS, Android).

## 6. Unified JavaScript API

All capabilities can be scripted using JavaScript. JS becomes a first-class way to write Karate tests alongside traditional `*.feature` files. A key goal is that testing any protocol: HTTP, GraphQL, gRPC, Kafka, or UI — feels the same. One syntax, one learning curve, skills that transfer. No reinventing the wheel for each new integration.

This also enables LLMs to control Karate in interactive REPL sessions. Allowing LLMs to write code instead of using a JSON schema based tool-use protocol has been [proven to be more effective, and use less tokens](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp).

## 7. Human and AI Friendly

Karate tests are known for being concise, business-focused, and readable—both by humans and by LLMs. A discoverable, self-describing command-line interface is essential for letting LLMs explore capabilities, invoke tools reliably, and minimize token usage.

Our goal is for Karate to be the best tool an LLM can use for anything involving API or test automation. To get there, we will prioritize a first-class CLI experience, and consider MCP support only if it becomes necessary. [Industry signals](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp) suggest that a well-designed CLI [often outperforms MCP-style integrations](https://kumak.dev/cli-vs-mcp-benchmarking-browser-automation) for agentic workflows, especially as teams increasingly adopt CLI-driven coding agents like Claude Code and OpenAI’s Codex. We expect this trend to accelerate.

## 8. Logging, Reporting and Observability

One thing that sets a testing framework apart from a normal runtime is the level of detail you get from reports after running a test. This is important for debugging and as an audit trail, especially in compliance-heavy business contexts. The built-in HTML templating has been in Karate from the start, and we will continue to support industry standards such as the JUnit XML and Cucumber JSON report data-formats. We will also collaborate closely with other testing and dev-tool projects to ensure enterprises have the best developer experience in local environments and CI/CD. Karate v2 will also improve observability, with more hook and callback options. LLMs will be able to pull logs and stack traces interactively via the CLI or a JavaScript API in a REPL or sandbox.

## 9. Embedded HTTP server and HTML engine

Thymeleaf-based HTML templating powered by our high-performance [JS engine](karate-js/README.md) enables:
* multiple report generation options
* micro-UI rendering for LLM sessions
* scaling from mock apps to enterprise applications
* custom HTML reports

Test result rendering can be aligned to the business domain of the system under test, enabling an experience that BDD (Behavior Driven Development) was expected to deliver in the past.
 
Other tooling from Karate Labs such as [Karate Xplorer](https://xplorer.karatelabs.io/) re-use the above capabilities and extend them.

## 10. Extensibility and Sustainable Open-Core

Some things like the JS engine are now core to Karate and locked in. But it should be possible to support custom protocols or integrations with minimal glue-code.

We plan to build a specification mapping layer into Karate v2 in the future. Think of it as a "better BDD approach." This will allow test scenarios to be viewed and edited in a business-friendly way and enable workflows such as test-coverage reporting and impact analysis.

The core is powerful, customizable, and fully open-source. Examples of commercial extensions (existing and planned) are the following:
* Async protocols such as WebSocket, gRPC and Kafka,
* Distributed testing
* Enhanced IDE support
* OpenAPI and JSON schema support
* API governance
* API security testing
* Requirements management

This funds continued innovation, a virtuous cycle where both tracks strengthen each other.
